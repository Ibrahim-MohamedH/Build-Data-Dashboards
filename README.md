# Udacity Build Data Dashboards
Project #3 of Udacity Data Analysis Advanced Nanodegree Program.

## Overview:
 Creating visualizations to reveal insights from a data set.
 
## Softwares Used:
 - Tableau public

## Project in details:
### USED DATASET:[2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data)

We will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. our work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

Questions asked:
1- Which States is the busiest and which one has the most departure delayed time?
2- Which airports in the top states have more delays than the others?
3- Which month has the most delays in the top 2 airports because of human intervene?

* Some of the columns we want to use in our project will have coded values that represent longer more readable values. For instance the "cancellation_reason" column in the flights data set has the values: A, B, C, D These letters are not understandable by themselves; These letters correspond with the following reasons:

A - Airline/Carrier
B - Weather
C - National Air System
D - Security
